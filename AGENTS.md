# AGENTS.md

- Treat `SKILL.md` as the primary contract for behavior and scope.
- Keep reference depth in `references/`; keep `SKILL.md` concise.
- Preserve existing conventions unless a change clearly improves reliability.
- Make focused edits; avoid unrelated churn.
- Validate changes before finishing (lint/tests/manual checks as applicable).
- Record new learnings in `notes/` and add missing-tool ideas to `notes/tool-ideas.md`.
- If instructions conflict or are unclear, stop and ask for clarification.
