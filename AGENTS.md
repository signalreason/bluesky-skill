# AGENTS.md

- if there is a spec, it's in `SPEC.md`.
- if there is a task list, it's in `prd.json`.
- remember! when you learn something, write it down. keep notes in whatever
  files you like under `notes/`. i recommend you keep an index of your notes for
  quick reading. you want to only load the notes you need when you need them so
  you don't overload your context and get confused.
- if you think of a tool that doesn't exist but would be useful for you, make a
  note of it.
- if any instructions are confusing or contradictory, stop and ask for
  clarification.

the purpose of this repository is to build an agent skill for working with the
[Bluesky Developer APIs](https://docs.bsky.app).
